# Views demo app

Joyride is a demo app made as an example of a "no-hand-off" workflow. We use Views Tools,
Create React App, and Create React Native App.
Joyride was done from scratch by one designer [Tom](https://github.com/tomatuxtemple)
and one developer [Dar√≠o](https://github.com/dariocravero) in total of 15 hours across
5 working days.
That includes design iterations, debugging, and beautifying refactoring.

Joyride lets you see bike stations around you and their availability. It works
on these cities: Amiens, Besancon, Brisbane, Bruxelles-Capitale, Cergy-Pontoise,
Creteil, Dublin, Goteborg, Kazan, Lillestrom, Ljubljana, Lund, Luxembourg, Lyon,
Marseille, Mulhouse, Namur, Nancy, Nantes, Rouen, Santander, Seville, Stockholm,
Toulouse, Toyama, Valence, Vilnius.

See how we built it on this blog post https://medium.com/@tomkaizen/531907dad23f.

Here you will find a [native](native) and [web](web) version of the same application.
